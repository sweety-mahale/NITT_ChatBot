      "Tiruchirappalli\n",
      "Tiruchirappalli City Tiruchirappalli is the fourth most populous city of Tamil Nadu. It is situated in the centre of the state, on the banks of the Kaveri River. The city is a City corporation, the administrative headquarters of Tiruchirapalli District.Trichy encompasses Srirangam , the foremost Vaishnavite temple and the biggest functioning Hindu temple in the world. Trichy also emcompasses \"ThiruAnaikka\" (ThiruvAnaikkaval), one of the five main abodes (\"Panchaboodha Sthalam\") of Lord Shiva. ThiruvAnaikkaval is the House of Water. OriginsThe name of the town, \"Tiruchirapalli\", originated as a tribute (thiru in Tamil means respected) to a Jain monk called \"Chira\". There is also a belief that Tiruchirapalli was named after a three headed demon \"Trishira\" (the son of Ravana) who performed penance at the Siva temple here and obtained boons here.There is yet another belief about the origins of the name Trichy. Apparently the name started out as Thiru Javvandhipuram (Place of Marigold flowers; javvandhi, the Tamil name for the flower Marigold which grew (and still does) in abundance in and around this region and the word puram refers to a place of dwelling) which over time became corrupted to Trichy.HistoryTiruchirapalli is home to many historic temples, monuments, churches and mosques. Uraiyur (also pronounced as Oraiyur) which is the Old Tiruchy has a long tradition. With over 2,500 years of known history, it was the capital of the early Cholas. The oldest man made dam Kallanai was built by Karaikala Cholan across the river Kaveri about 10 miles from Uraiyur. It was an important town in the days of the later Cholas, Nayaks as well as during the early days of the British East India Company. The conquest of Tiruchirapalli by the British East India Company marked a major step in the British conquest of India.Transport Trichy is well connected to various parts of Tamil Nadu, by private and public bus services. The Theppakulam (chathram) bus station, near Rock Fort temple, runs local and mofussil (city-to-city) bus services which connect people to nearby towns and villages. Bus services are frequent, once every two to five minutes.Trichy is also well-connected to the other cities of Tamil Nadu, southern Karnataka and Kerala through private charter buses.The central bus station runs long distance services to major cities of the State and South India such as Chennai, Madurai, Coimbatore, Bangalore, Erode, Thiruvananthapuram and Tirupathi. One can get buses from Trichy to almost any part of the state, due to its geographical location in the center of Tamil Nadu.On the road infrastructure front, with the completion of highway projects in Tamil Nadu state, Trichy will have four track highways from the city branching to destination Chennai, Madurai, Tanjore.EducationConsidered an educational town, Tiruchirapalli has schools and colleges that are hundreds of years old.

      "Ragging is a disturbing reality in the higher education system of our country. Despite the fact that over the years, ragging has claimed hundreds of innocent lives and has ruined the careers of thousands of bright students, the practice is still perceived by many as a way of ‘familiarisation’ and an ‘initiation into the real world’ for young college-going students. The Ragging is defined as any disorderly conduct, whether by words spoken or written or by an act, has the effect of teasing, treating, or handling with rudeness a fresher or a junior student. Indulging in a rowdy or undisciplined activity that causes or is likely to cause annoyance, hardship, or psychological harm or to raise fear or apprehension thereof in a fresher or junior student. Asking the students to do any act or perform something that such students will not do in the ordinary course and which has the effect of causing or generating a sense of shame or embarrassment so as to adversely affect the physique or psyche of a fresher or junior student. This can lead to adverse effects such as depression, anxiety, and sometimes even suicide.\n",

      "The Study in India program has designed a framework to award scholarships and tuition fee waivers for meritorious students applying to the program. The Study in India team has collaborated with the Indian government wings - MHRD, MEA, and MIC, to draw out this scheme. The program offers scholarships called the Study in India Scholarships on an annual basis, while its partner institutes provide tuition fee waivers.\n",
      "The Study in India Scholarship scheme covers the admission fees, tuition fees, accommodation (room and boring) costs, and food costs. Any costs and expenses outside the above mentioned are not considered under this scheme. The scheme is further divided into two sub-schemes, based on a merit list and the Ind-SAT examination. A set of scholarships are offered based on a merit-list, which is evaluated and verified by the Study in India team during the document verification process. The team also reviews and awards scholarships to exemplary students who appear for the online-proctored, 90-minute Ind-SAT examination conducted by the Study in India team and the National Testing Agency.\n",

      "NITTFEST\n",
      "NITT has always believed in the philosophy that the development of an individual is not accomplished through pedantic learning alone but should be complimented by a healthy dose of co-curricular and extra curricular activities too. The foremost example of this philosophy is 'NITTFEST' - an annual extravaganza of fine arts!    During NITTFEST, departments square off against each other over two days, on an even keel, to battle over quizzes, debates, music, terpischorean delights and more - small battles fought under the umbrella of a big war. A war which shall on a pleasant Sunday evening, determine the best of them all. It is during such battles that the ceiling of belonging to the department merges and grows to its zenith. a time when heros emerge in all, heartbreak for some, ecstasy for others, but glory for the college and a treat for all. It is thus evident that NITTFEST is more than just a fest - it is in effect, a tribute to the creative genius inherent in every Nittian. In keeping with its tradition, the high standards of NITTFEST assure the sponsor a high degree of exposure, one that spans a community of over 3000. \n",

      "Rock Fort Temple This temple crowns a massive outcrop of rock, that soars 83 meters upwards, from the surrounding plains. It is reached by a steep flight of 437 steps, cut into the rock. Halfway up is the Sri Thayumanaswamy Temple, dedicated to Lord Shiva. It has a 100-pillared hall, and a Vimana, covered with gold. On the southern face of the rock, are several beautifully carved, rock-cut cave temples, of the Pallava period. Non - Hindus are not allowed into the sanctum sanctorum, at the summit. Built by the Nayaks, who were the founders of the city, it was one of the main centers around which the wars of the Carnatic were fought in the 18th century during the British - French struggle for supremacy in India.     Sri Rangam (Sri Ranganathaswamy Temple) This temple, 6 kms north of the city, is among the most revered shrines to Lord Vishnu in South India, and probably, the largest temple complex in the country. Enclosed by seven rectangular walled courtyards, this 13th century temple has 21 gopurams. The town, and the temple, are set on a 250-hectare island in the Cauvery, connected to the mainland by a bridge. The temple is very well preserved, with excellent carvings, and numerous shrines to various gods, though the main temple is dedicated to Vishnu.     Tiruvanaikkaval The Jambukeshwara temple, here, is dedicated to Shiva, and it houses five concentric walls, and seven gopurams.

This literary group was the first of its kind in Tamil Nadu and the whole of South India, where Hindi is not widely spoken. The motive behind establishing Aayaam was to promote the love for Hindi in Trichy in general and NIT Trichy in particular. It provides a common platform to all the Hindi speaking people to make their voice heard on a mass scale, in form of their literary works. It is a platform for those who admire Hindi literature and want to bring forward their creativity in story writing, poem composition or any form of composition in Hindi.\n",
